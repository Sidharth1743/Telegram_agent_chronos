Yes. Multiple peer‐reviewed studies have established an association between standing posture and skeletal development.

One study describes a clear relationship between body composition, standing posture, and bone mineral density in children. Specifically, it shows that lower adiposity is linked to a flattened spine, whereas higher levels of fat and fat‐free mass correspond to a rounded posture that is positively associated with increased bone mineral density. This study directly supports the claim by illustrating how specific postural configurations relate to skeletal properties (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15).

Another paper examines the association between standing posture and bone development, reporting that a flat posture is inversely related to certain bone physical properties while a rounded posture shows a positive relationship with bone properties. This work reinforces the concept that various postural patterns have distinct implications for skeletal health within a shared biomechanical environment (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6).

Further evidence comes from research focusing on the relationship between sagittal posture and bone structure in children. This study emphasizes that mechanical loading imposed by variations in body mass and composition influences both bone development and postural health. By highlighting the role of extra-skeletal tissues in enhancing bone mineral accrual, the work underscores the biological connection between posture and skeletal development (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11).

Moreover, a study on sagittal spino-pelvic alignment across childhood and adolescence has demonstrated that proper postural alignment develops in tandem with musculoskeletal growth. It provides evidence that the maturation of the skeletal system is closely linked to the evolution of standing posture over time (araujo2017definingpatternsof pages 1-7).

In addition, research on the evolution of postural alignment from ages 4 to 12 indicates that significant changes in standing posture during these formative years correlate with normal skeletal maturation. This study highlights that alterations in the sagittal plane can reflect processes of skeletal development, including adaptation to mechanical loads during growth (lafond2007posturaldevelopmentin pages 5-6).

Finally, a study investigating sagittal standing posture in adolescents in the context of spinal pain emphasizes the importance of achieving physiological standards of alignment during critical stages of skeletal growth. Although the primary focus is on pain outcomes, it frames the recruitment of subjects by their maturation status and age at peak height velocity, thereby linking postural alignment with key milestones in skeletal development (dolphens2012sagittalstandingposture pages 6-7).

In summary, the collective evidence across these studies consistently indicates that standing posture and skeletal development are interlinked. The various investigations show that postural characteristics—ranging from flattened to rounded configurations—are associated with differences in bone mineral density, structural properties, and overall skeletal maturation. Each piece of research contributes to a robust evidence base supporting the association between standing posture and the development of the skeletal system in pediatric populations (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11, araujo2017definingpatternsof pages 1-7, lafond2007posturaldevelopmentin pages 5-6, dolphens2012sagittalstandingposture pages 6-7).
