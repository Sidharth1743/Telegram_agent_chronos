Yes. The literature has addressed the association between normal posture and typical posture. Historically, concepts of “normal” or “standard” posture were linked to ideal, upright alignments associated with health, as seen in earlier interpretations (barralopez2024thestandardposture pages 3-4). Over time, however, these definitions have been scrutinized. Some authors demonstrate that, while “normal” posture originally referred to an ideal alignment, in practice, normalcy is defined through a range of postural characteristics that emerge from statistical averages and individual anatomical variations (bullocksaxton1988normalandabnormal pages 3-5, ohlendorf2018standardreferencevalues pages 4-5).

For example, Bullock-Saxton’s approach in describing normal posture indicates that the standard pelvic and spinal alignments, although having definable parameters, do not represent a singular “ideal” but rather a spectrum of typical alignments observed across individuals (bullocksaxton1988normalandabnormal pages 3-5). This view is bolstered by studies that derive standard reference values for body posture among healthy populations, thereby linking statistically defined norms to what is considered typical posture (ohlendorf2018standardreferencevalues pages 4-5). In this way, defining normal posture in terms of typical postural averages is a practice that has been carried out.

On the other hand, there are notable critiques that complicate a straightforward association. Some sources point out that modern assessments of posture recognize significant individual variability. They contend that the traditional conflation of “normal” and “typical” overlooks the dynamic nature of human posture and the inherent differences influenced by factors such as race, gender, and cultural practices (rosario2017whatisposture? pages 6-8). Similarly, the discussion that contrasts typical (often labeled “ideal”) posture with natural, comfortable postures illustrates that what has been traditionally deemed normal does not necessarily capture the full range of typical postural behavior (barralopez2024thestandardposture pages 5-6).

Further, the ergonomic literature implicitly supports this association by emphasizing that effective workspace design must consider normal postural behaviors, which are understood in terms of typical anatomical and functional patterns (bridger1991somefundamentalaspects pages 1-3). Although some sources, such as those reflecting on Kendall’s manual, note that no individual perfectly manifests the ideal posture, the existence of normative postural parameters remains a cornerstone in both clinical and ergonomic contexts (barralopez2024thestandardposture pages 4-5).

In summary, multiple lines of research have claimed that normal posture is associated with typical posture. On one hand, standard anatomical and statistical approaches provide a basis for defining normal posture as a composite of typical alignments (bullocksaxton1988normalandabnormal pages 3-5, ohlendorf2018standardreferencevalues pages 4-5); on the other, modern critiques emphasize that such an association is nuanced by individual and contextual factors (rosario2017whatisposture? pages 6-8, barralopez2024thestandardposture pages 5-6). Thus, the claim has indeed been explored with evidence supporting an association, while simultaneously acknowledging that the definitions of normal and typical posture are complex and multifaceted.
