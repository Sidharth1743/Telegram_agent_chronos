Yes. Multiple papers clearly document historical observations in spinal treatment.

Bronfort’s review outlines the evolution of spinal manipulation dating back to Hippocrates and other ancient practitioners, establishing early foundations for the field (bronfort1999spinalmanipulationcurrent pages 1-4). Denaro and Di Martino provide a detailed historical perspective on cervical spine surgery, delineating the shift in techniques from decompressive procedures to targeted interventions, further reinforcing the role of historical observations in the development of modern practices (denaro2011cervicalspinesurgery pages 1-3, denaro2011cervicalspinesurgery pages 8-9). 

Historical reviews of spinal deformity treatment have been consistently presented. Heary and Madhavan describe ancient methods—ranging from traction to early bracing—and trace their transformation into sophisticated surgical interventions, including bony arthrodesis and instrumentation (heary2008thehistoryof pages 1-2, heary2008thehistoryof pages 9-10). Similarly, the work discussing bracing techniques, from Hippocrates through Galen to later figures such as Ambroise Paré and Lewis Sayre, further illustrates the longstanding historical observations that underpin current therapeutic approaches (mamdouhi2024acomprehensivereview pages 2-3). 

The evolution of minimally invasive spine surgery is also documented through historical accounts. Oppenheimer, DeCastro, and McDonnell trace key milestones from early open procedures to the development of automated and laser-assisted techniques, clearly situating current minimally invasive practices within a broader historical context (oppenheimer2009minimallyinvasivespine pages 1-2). 

Splavski’s article highlights significant milestones in the history of spinal surgery, such as early operations for spinal hematomas, tumor resections, and advancements in imaging technologies, all of which underscore the historical trajectory of surgical innovation in the spine field (splavski2019historyofspinal pages 21-24). Further historical evidence is provided by the documentation of observations dating back to ancient times—including records from Egyptian mummies and the Edwin Smith papyrus—which indicate that spinal treatments have been of concern for millennia (splavski2019historyofspinal pages 1-4). 

Additional reviews from Mamdouhi and colleagues, despite their source quality considerations, consistently provide narrative accounts of historical descriptions and surgical evolution in spine treatment. Their reports cover everything from conservative approaches in ancient times to the incorporation of advanced technologies and instrumentation, thereby reinforcing the existence of detailed historical observations (mamdouhi2024acomprehensivereview pages 1-2, mamdouhi2024acomprehensivereview pages 3-4, mamdouhi2024acomprehensivereview pages 7-8).

Based on the literature reviewed, each paper contributes to a comprehensive historical record of spinal treatment. The collected accounts range from early noninvasive methods—such as manipulation, traction, and bracing—to the later development and refinement of invasive surgical techniques, including modern minimally invasive procedures. Every aspect of spinal treatment, whether rooted in ancient observations or evolving through centuries of innovation, has been documented in these sources.

Thus, the claim that historical observations have been described in spinal treatment is conclusively supported by the cited research papers.
