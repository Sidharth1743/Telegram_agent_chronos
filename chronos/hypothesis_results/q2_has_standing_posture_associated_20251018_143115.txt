Yes. Multiple papers provide explicit evidence that standing posture is associated with skeletal development. Based on the reported findings, the mechanostat theory serves as the central framework. It describes how habitual mechanical loading—including that from standing posture—triggers local adaptive responses in bone through remodeling and modeling mechanisms (pangka2016biomechanicalmeasuresof pages 18-23, pearson2004theagingof pages 14-15, hughes2010revisitingharoldfrosts pages 25-29). These studies indicate that mechanical strains from everyday postural activities are integral to regulating bone mass and architecture.

Several investigations have focused on children, demonstrating a measurable relationship between specific postural patterns and bone mineral density. For example, findings indicate that a rounded posture, characterized by increased lumbar angles, correlates with elevated bone mineral density, whereas a flattened posture is inversely related to bone properties (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11). These observations reinforce the notion that the mechanical forces experienced during standing are closely linked to the physical stimuli governing skeletal development.

The review of the literature further shows that weight-bearing activities—which inherently include maintaining proper standing posture—are pivotal for skeletal health. Studies emphasize that the mechanics of standing influence the mechanical environment of bones, thereby affecting bone strength and overall integrity (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 19-23, kontulainen2007thebiomechanicalbasis pages 13-15). Additionally, research in both human and animal models underscores that the coordinated development of the skeleton is contingent on the forces generated during upright stance, which drive adaptive skeletal responses (moulia2006posturecontroland pages 3-4, greene2006adaptiveskeletalresponses pages 1-3).

Moreover, the mechanistic explanation provided in several papers highlights not only the role of gravitational and muscle-derived forces during standing but also the sensitivity of bone cells to these mechanical inputs. Osteocytes, for instance, are shown to detect variations in mechanical load and contribute to the adaptive remodeling process, which ultimately contributes to maintaining structural competence (pivonka2018functionaladaptationof pages 8-11, pangka2016biomechanicalmeasuresof pages 26-30, pivonka2018functionaladaptationof pages 3-6, schoenau2008mechanicalinfluenceson pages 1-2). This continuous feedback mechanism confirms that mechanical loading from daily postural activities is a key factor influencing skeletal development throughout life.

Collectively, the reviewed literature demonstrates through both theoretical models and empirical data that standing posture plays a central role in skeletal development. The converging lines of evidence—from mechanistic studies on bone adaptation to empirical investigations correlating postural patterns with bone mineral metrics—confirm that the association between standing posture and skeletal development has been clearly established (pangka2016biomechanicalmeasuresof pages 18-23, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 19-23, moulia2006posturecontroland pages 3-4).
