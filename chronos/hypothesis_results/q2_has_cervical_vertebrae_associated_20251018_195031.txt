Yes. Multiple studies indicate that cervical vertebrae are directly associated with upright posture.

The evolution of bipedalism is marked by distinct anatomical changes in the spine. One study details the emergence of cervical and lumbar lordosis as part of the body’s adaptation to upright locomotion, with cervical adjustments facilitating the balance necessary for an erect stance (bazert2015bipedalismpelvic–spinalbalance pages 1-3). This work demonstrates that the morphological transition in the cervical area is an integral element of the evolutionary response to the demands of bipedalism.

Developmental research further supports this association. As infants acquire the ability to sustain head control, the cervical vertebrae undergo noticeable changes—specifically, the development of cervical lordosis—which in turn aids the verticalization of the spine and pelvis. This sequential maturation of spinal curvatures underpins the shift from a horizontal to an upright posture, emphasizing that cervical spine development is closely linked to bipedalism (bazert2015bipedalismpelvic–spinalbalance pages 5-7).

Additionally, specific anatomical analyses show that the cervical vertebrae play a central role in maintaining skull support and enabling independent head movement. The unique orientation of the cervical spine, particularly its right-angled relationship with the skull base, is essential for positioning the head above the thorax in an upright posture. This structural arrangement is identified as a key adaptation in human bipedalism (bazert2015bipedalismpelvic–spinalbalance pages 7-9).

Comparative anatomical studies further underscore this relationship. Research contrasting modern humans with apes notes that humans possess a pronounced cervical lordosis that situates the head optimally above the thorax, a feature absent or far less developed in quadrupedal primates. This difference in cervical spine curvature clearly demarcates the adaptations required for bipedalism (ezra2019cervicalposturepain pages 10-12).

Moreover, evidence from detailed biomechanical analyses clarifies that the defined cervical lordosis in modern humans is beneficial for maintaining an erect posture. The cervical vertebrae, by virtue of their shape and alignment, contribute directly to sustaining the head’s position as well as overall balance, which are critical for bipedal locomotion (ezra2019cervicalposturepain pages 12-15).

Finally, a synthesis of multiple anatomical perspectives in a comprehensive review emphasizes that the cervical vertebrae are among the key spinal adaptations facilitating the transition from quadrupedalism to upright gait. This review integrates functional anatomy and biomechanical demands, clearly identifying cervical vertebral adaptations as centrally important for achieving and maintaining an upright posture (niemitz2010theevolutionof pages 1-2).

Based on the available research, it is clear that the association between cervical vertebrae characteristics—especially the development of cervical lordosis—and the maintenance of an upright posture has been well documented. Each source provides specific anatomical and developmental evidence that links the structure and function of the cervical vertebrae to the biomechanical requirements of bipedalism.
