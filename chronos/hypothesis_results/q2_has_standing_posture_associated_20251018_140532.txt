Yes. The literature indicates that the relationship between standing posture and skeletal development has been empirically explored.

In (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15) the study explicitly investigates the relationship between standing posture and skeletal development in children. It demonstrates that variations in body mass index and body composition affect postural patterns, noting that a hypercurved spine is associated with increased body mass and bone density. This work illustrates how the increased load from body weight alters mechanical forces on the skeleton, thereby influencing its development.

Similarly, (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11) focuses on the connection between bone structure and sagittal posture in children. It highlights that the biomechanical environment in which both bone and posture develop is shared and that mechanical loading due to variations in body composition has measurable effects on skeletal health. The study thereby supports the assertion that alterations in standing posture are linked to changes in skeletal development.

Further evidence is provided by (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6), which explores how habitual mechanical stimulation resulting from standing posture influences bone quality and resistance. This research reports an inverse association between flat posture and bone physical properties, in contrast to a rounded posture, which shows a positive association with higher bone mineral density. Such findings reinforce the link between standing posture and skeletal development by showing how different postural characteristics correspond with distinct bone parameters.

Additionally, (aleshina2015theformationof pages 4-5) discusses the formation of posture in pupils and underscores that proper posture is essential for harmonious skeletal growth. It implies that the development of correct posture is intrinsically linked to the proper formation of the skeletal system, thereby offering further conceptual support for a direct association.

Studies focusing on craniofacial and cranio-cervical regions also contribute to this body of evidence. The research detailed in (solow2002craniocervicalposturea pages 1-3) describes the significant relationship between head/neck posture and craniofacial skeletal development. It correlates specific postural types, such as an extended cranio-cervical posture, with defined craniofacial morphologies and mandibular inclinations. This establishes that postural variations, even when localized to the head and neck, are closely related to skeletal developmental outcomes.

Similarly, (solow2002craniocervicalposturea pages 3-5) provides supportive evidence by linking cranio-cervical posture with craniofacial morphology and skeletal development, particularly of the mandible. It shows that changes in cranio-cervical angles are directly associated with growth patterns in craniofacial structures, thereby emphasizing the role of posture in skeletal development.

While (le2013humanposturerecognition pages 6-6) addresses human posture recognition using skeleton data from the Kinect device, its focus on the accurate classification of static postures—including standing posture—provides indirect support by demonstrating the validity of using skeletal features to identify and analyze postural states. This technological application underlines the relevance of skeletal data in discerning postural characteristics that are, in turn, related to skeletal structure.

Collectively, these studies demonstrate that research has indeed been conducted to establish an association between standing posture and skeletal development. The evidence spans biomechanical analyses, observational studies in pediatric populations, and investigations of craniofacial growth patterns, affirming that standing posture is intricately linked to the development and structural formation of the skeleton (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, aleshina2015theformationof pages 4-5, solow2002craniocervicalposturea pages 1-3, solow2002craniocervicalposturea pages 3-5, le2013humanposturerecognition pages 6-6).
