Yes. Multiple investigations have directly examined the association between standing posture and skeletal development, with several studies demonstrating that variations in sagittal posture correlate with differences in bone physical properties and structure.

Research in pediatric populations has provided the strongest evidence for this relationship. Investigations by Araújo and colleagues show that children with a flat posture exhibit reduced bone quality, whereas those with a rounded or hypercurved posture exhibit enhanced bone physical properties such as increased bone mineral density. These studies clearly indicate that habitual mechanical loading derived from standing posture is linked to bone development and stress resistance (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15).

In these studies, the authors show that the biomechanical environment in which both bone and posture develop is influenced by several factors including body composition. They emphasize that mechanical stimulation through everyday postural behaviors contributes to skeletal health by modulating bone quality during growth (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6). The findings support a model wherein the mechanical forces exerted by posture during weight-bearing activities influence bone adaptation and maturation.

Evidence also extends to adolescence, a critical period for skeletal development. Studies focusing on adolescent populations have linked postural variations with skeletal changes that occur during rapid growth phases. In particular, the association between altered postural balance and conditions such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis reinforces the idea that standing posture influences skeletal development during periods of accelerated change (dolphens2012sagittalstandingposture pages 2-3, NCT05127902).

While the majority of the developmental evidence is drawn from pediatric and adolescent studies, data in adult populations further support the notion of an integrated musculoskeletal system. Investigations in adults have assessed how standing posture relates to skeletal alignment and balance. Although these studies primarily address maintenance and age-related changes in skeletal structure rather than early development, the underlying biomechanical principles remain comparable. They confirm that gravitational forces and habitual loading continue to influence the skeletal system throughout life (hasegawa2017standingsagittalalignment pages 1-2, czaprowski2018nonstructuralmisalignmentsof pages 1-2).

Additional work focusing on mechanical stimulation and gravitational loading has highlighted how variations in habitual posture can alter bending and compressive forces on the spine, thereby affecting both structure and function. Such findings imply that the mechanical interactions between postural alignment and skeletal loading are consistent across different age groups, from childhood through to older adulthood (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, maejima2004therelationshipbetween pages 1-2).

Overall, the literature collectively demonstrates that standing posture is not an isolated attribute but is integrally linked to the development and maintenance of the skeletal system. The clear associations observed in children—where altered postural patterns correspond with measurable differences in bone properties—provide compelling evidence that standing posture is indeed associated with skeletal development. This interrelationship is further substantiated by data on postural balance, spinal alignment, and musculoskeletal function across the lifespan. 

Thus, the claim that standing posture is associated with skeletal development has been empirically addressed and supported by research across multiple studies and age groups (araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 1-6, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 11-15, araujo2017asharedbiomechanical pages 6-11, dolphens2012sagittalstandingposture pages 2-3, hasegawa2017standingsagittalalignment pages 1-2, czaprowski2018nonstructuralmisalignmentsof pages 1-2).
