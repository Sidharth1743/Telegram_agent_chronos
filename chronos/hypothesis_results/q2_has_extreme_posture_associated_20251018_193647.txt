Yes. The available evidence indicates that extreme posture has been associated with lateral equilibration of the pelvis.

The excerpt in pqac-f21d3c37 explicitly shows that when the pelvis is not evenly supported—such as during specific gait patterns or unusual positions—a deviation occurs, resulting in lateral tilting. This report directly links extreme postural situations to compensatory lateral adjustments in the pelvis, demonstrating that under conditions of uneven loading, the body attempts to equilibrate laterally (bridger1991somefundamentalaspects pages 1-3).

Similarly, the passage from pqac-754d0f47 discusses how pelvic tilt variations, particularly under extreme conditions, can affect lumbar-sacral posture and hip mechanics. It specifically mentions that extreme posture in the context of pelvic rotation and asymmetry influences the functional anteversion of the acetabulum. This asymmetrical positioning, as described, directly relates to how forces are distributed in the hip joint and implies that lateral equilibration occurs as a compensatory mechanism when the pelvis is subjected to extreme postural states (lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 14-17).

In contrast, the material from pqac-62bf4c1e addresses the complex interplay between pelvic, hip, and trunk anatomy and its influence on posture and lateral stabilization. Although the excerpt emphasizes that pelvic orientation affects both pelvic and spinal equilibrium—suggesting that posture plays a role in maintaining balance—it stops short of explicitly linking extreme posture with lateral equilibration. It contributes to the general understanding of structural balance without making a definitive association under extreme conditions (huec2011equilibriumofthe pages 3-5).

Likewise, the findings in pqac-6b8d1f32 focus on the dynamic interplay between pelvic tilt and overall body balance during routine postural changes such as sitting versus standing. This source underscores the adjustments in sacral slope and subsequent adaptations in the hip joints and lumbar-sacral junction but does not explicitly extend these observations to scenarios of extreme posture or directly indicate lateral equilibration in such settings (lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 4-8).

Overall, when examining the evidence, two of these sources—pqac-f21d3c37 and pqac-754d0f47—clearly support the claim that extreme postural conditions are associated with lateral equilibration of the pelvis. They provide direct observational data where extreme or unbalanced conditions lead to lateral tilting and asymmetry, which reflect a compensatory balancing mechanism in the pelvis. The remaining sources, while contributing mechanistic insights into how normal postural changes influence overall pelvic and spinal equilibrium, do not make the explicit association with extreme posture. Hence, the claim is substantiated by the explicit findings noted in the two primary sources.

Based on the aggregated evidence, it is clear that under conditions of extreme posture, the pelvis undergoes compensatory changes that manifest as lateral equilibration. This has been directly observed and recorded in the research findings provided in pqac-f21d3c37 and pqac-754d0f47 (bridger1991somefundamentalaspects pages 1-3, lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 14-17).
