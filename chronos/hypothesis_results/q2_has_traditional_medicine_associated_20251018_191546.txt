Yes, multiple research papers have made explicit claims linking traditional medicine, particularly traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with spinal health.

Several narrative reviews focus on non-operative treatments for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (LIDH) and illustrate that TCM modalities—including Chinese massage (Tuina) and specific herbal formulations like Duhuojisheng Tang and Buyanghuanwu Tang—play a role in mitigating pain and improving spinal function (zhang2017anarrativereview pages 5-6). Moreover, another review emphasizes acupuncture's growing acceptance among LIDH patients, reflecting its perceived benefits in stimulating blood circulation and alleviating musculoskeletal discomfort (zhang2017anarrativereview pages 2-4).

The substantial research interest in this area is further underscored by a ClinicalTrials.gov query, which yielded nearly 15,000 trials investigating traditional medicine in the context of spinal conditions. This large number indicates that the intersection of traditional medicine and spinal health is an active field of research (Clinical Trial Search: e9a3f18496e7).

Meta-analyses have also been conducted to compare TCM with Western approaches in the management of neck and low back pain. One such analysis reported that TCM offers superior analgesic effects and has a favorable safety profile compared to conventional Western treatments (deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 1-2). Additional studies further highlight the efficacy and safety of TCM practices, such as acupuncture and fumigation, in managing spinal pain (deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 12-15).

Furthermore, several studies delve into the pharmacological and mechanistic basis of TCM. They report that specific herbal remedies and treatment principles—such as using herbs to invigorate blood circulation, activate tendons, and reduce inflammation—are applied to improve spinal health. An article specifically associates Chinese medicine’s approach to low back pain, pointing to treatments that aim to correct liver and kidney deficiencies as well as blood stasis, thereby contributing to spinal repair and improved bone mineral content (deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 2-4).

A holistic view of TCM is also reinforced through discussions of its comprehensive approach, where techniques such as qigong, acupuncture, and herbal therapy work in concert to enhance the overall health of patients suffering from spinal disorders (deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 4-6). Complementary to this, reviews of non-operative management strategies for LIDH incorporate TCM as one of several effective alternatives, further supporting an association between traditional medicine and spinal health (zhang2017anarrativereview pages 1-2).

Innovative techniques within the TCM domain, such as acupotomy—which blends acupuncture with surgical elements—have been highlighted as promising methods for providing pain relief in LIDH patients, thereby reinforcing the clinical relevance of traditional approaches (zhang2017anarrativereview pages 4-5). Additionally, further reviews emphasize that herbal remedies like Huang-Qi and Du-Zhong have been recognized for their potential to reduce pain and improve bone health, which directly supports spinal health outcomes (zhang2017anarrativereview pages 6-8, zhang2017anarrativereview pages 8-9).

In summary, the review of available literature from multiple sources consistently substantiates the claim that traditional medicine is associated with spinal health, both in addressing symptoms of pain and in contributing to overall spinal repair and maintenance. Each study, whether discussing direct clinical applications or underlying pharmacological mechanisms, supports the integration of traditional medicine into the realm of spinal health management (zhang2017anarrativereview pages 5-6, zhang2017anarrativereview pages 2-4, Clinical Trial Search: e9a3f18496e7, deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 1-2, deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 12-15, deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 2-4, deng2023acomprehensivemetaanalysis pages 4-6, zhang2017anarrativereview pages 1-2, zhang2017anarrativereview pages 4-5, zhang2017anarrativereview pages 6-8, zhang2017anarrativereview pages 8-9).
