Yes. Based on the relevant papers I found, extreme pelvic postures—manifested as pronounced rotations or atypical tilt variations—are directly associated with disturbances in lateral pelvic equilibrium.

The first paper (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 11-13) explicitly links extreme pelvic rotation, particularly in cases of deformities such as scoliosis, with significant impacts on lateral equilibrium. The authors discuss how this extreme rotation alters the balance of the pelvis, especially in patients undergoing hip surgeries, thereby directly confirming the claim that an extreme posture is associated with lateral pelvic equilibrium disruptions (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 11-13).

Further supporting this, the third paper (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 1-2) emphasizes that variations in pelvic tilt, specifically extreme anterior and posterior tilts, result in changes in the pelvis’s lateral positioning. This source details how modifications in pelvic posture affect overall trunk balance, thereby underlining the relationship between extreme postural deviations and altered lateral equilibrium of the pelvis (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 1-2).

Additionally, the second paper (lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 8-11) examines the relationship between sagittal imbalance and pelvic positioning in both standing and sitting postures. Although its primary focus is on sagittal alignment and its effect on acetabular orientation in total hip arthroplasty, it also addresses how loss of acceptable pelvic tilt variation between positions can diminish the pelvis’s adaptability. This indirectly supports the claim since extreme or atypical postures in the sagittal plane contribute to dysregulation of pelvic equilibrium, including its lateral aspects (lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 8-11).

Collectively, these findings indicate that the effects of extreme pelvic postures are not confined solely to the sagittal plane but extend to influence lateral pelvic equilibrium. The explicit mention of extreme pelvic rotation in (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 11-13) and the detailed explanation of how tilt variations affect lateral positioning in (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 1-2) strongly affirm that such postural extremes are associated with disturbances in lateral balance. The observations made in (lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 8-11) further reinforce this relationship by delineating how aberrant postural dynamics can impair overall pelvic function, suggesting an interplay between sagittal deviations and lateral stability.

In summary, the documented research provides clear evidence that extreme postural changes—whether expressed as excessive pelvic rotation or abnormal tilt variations—lead to significant alterations in the lateral equilibrium of the pelvis. The claim that “extreme posture is associated with lateral equilibrium pelvis” is well supported by the information presented in these studies (lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 11-13, lazennec2013lumbarpelvicfemoralbalanceon pages 8-11, lazennec2011hip–spinerelationsand pages 1-2).
